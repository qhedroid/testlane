# Relay

**Internal QA test management platform — design and architecture exploration.**

Relay is a purpose-built replacement for TestRail and Testiny, designed for QA teams working across multiple enterprise product modules. This repository contains the interactive prototype, architecture documentation, MVP scope, and proposal materials.

---

## Why Relay exists

Generic test management tools serve every team equally, which means they serve no team particularly well. QA engineers working across CTMS, eTMF, SSO/IAM, Viewer, Reporting, and API Gateway modules spend time translating between a tool's generic mental model and their actual work.

Relay removes that translation layer. Folder structures, test plans, run assignments, and execution flows are organised around real module boundaries. The product is QA-first.

**Problems it addresses directly:**
- No full-text search in Testiny (the most frequently cited pain point)
- TestRail's legacy UI adds unnecessary clicks to every workflow
- Audit logs and SSO paywalled at enterprise tier in both tools
- No API precondition setup before test execution begins
- Seat-based pricing does not suit an internal team

## Interactive prototype

Open `mockup/index.html` directly. No build step required.

| View | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | Active run cards, pass rate, failures, module coverage |
| Test Cases | Resizable three-panel layout with detail tabs |
| Test Plans | Tabbed detail with Overview / Test Cases / Runs / Metrics |
| Test Runs | Searchable run selector, execution panel with full tab set |
| Global Search | Cmd K palette across cases, runs, and plans |
| Audit History | Append-only event log |

Keyboard shortcuts in Test Runs: `P` Pass · `F` Fail · `B` Blocked · `S` Skip · `D` Defect · `J/K` Navigate · `?` Shortcuts

## Architecture

```
Browser → Next.js (App Router, full-stack)
  └── Service layer
        ├── TestCaseService / TestRunService / TestPlanService
        ├── SearchService → AWS OpenSearch (_msearch fan-out)
        └── AuditService  → append-only audit_log table
  └── Drizzle ORM (MySQL adapter) → MySQL on AWS RDS 8.0 / Aurora MySQL
  └── AWS hosting (ECS or App Runner)
```

---

## Stack

| Layer | Decision |
|---|---|
| Frontend / Backend | Next.js (App Router, API routes) |
| Database | MySQL on AWS RDS 8.0 / Aurora MySQL 3.x |
| ORM | Drizzle ORM, MySQL adapter |
| Search | AWS OpenSearch Service |
| Hosting | AWS — required by internal DevOps |
| Auth | In-house (architecture designed, deferred) |
| Storage | AWS S3 (Phase 2) |

---

## MVP scope

1. Test case management — folders, steps, creation, editing, assignment
2. Test runs — create, execute, assign, track, seal (immutable); Admin reopen only
3. Test plans — configure environment, assignees, case selection, spawn runs
4. Dashboard and metrics — pass rate, active runs, failures, coverage
5. Full-text search — Cmd K palette, typo-tolerant, grouped results
6. Audit logs — append-only, built in, not paywalled

---

## Key decisions

- **Execution snapshotting** — results are tied to the case as it existed at run time
- **Run sealing enforced at the API layer** — not just the UI
- **Append-only audit log** — no deletions or updates to event rows
- **MySQL primary, OpenSearch for search, no NoSQL at MVP**

## Local development

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, pnpm 9+, Docker.

### First-time setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Environment
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start MySQL and OpenSearch
pnpm docker:up

# 4. Apply schema migrations (db:migrate waits for MySQL automatically)
pnpm db:migrate

# 5. Load development seed data
pnpm db:seed

# 6. Run the Next.js app
pnpm dev
```

### Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

A healthy response includes `"status":"ok"` and `"mysql":"ok"`.

Check seed data in MySQL:

```bash
docker compose exec mysql mysql -u relay -prelay relay -e \
  "SELECT slug, name FROM projects; SELECT plan_ref, title, status FROM test_plans;"
```

### Reset local database

Wipes Docker volumes and rebuilds from scratch:

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d
pnpm db:migrate    # waits for MySQL, then applies migrations
pnpm db:seed       # waits for MySQL, then loads relay-dev data
```

After `docker compose up -d`, MySQL needs 30–60 seconds on first start. `pnpm db:migrate` and `pnpm db:seed` wait automatically; or run `pnpm db:wait` on its own.

`pnpm db:seed` is idempotent: it clears the `relay-dev` organisation and reinserts all seed rows. Safe to re-run locally.

### Seed data overview

| Entity | Details |
|---|---|
| Organisation | `relay-dev` — Relay Development Organisation |
| Users | Noel Quadri (super_admin), Shaun Sevume (admin), Priya Nair (contributor), Marcus Webb (admin), James O'Sullivan (contributor) |
| Projects | CTMS, eTMF, Viewer, SSO/IAM, Reporting, API Gateway |
| Test plan | CTMS `PLAN-001` — active, UAT, 4 cases (for `TestRunService.create()` testing) |
| ref_counters | Per-project case/run/plan counters (helper table) |

Stable IDs for `TestRunService.create()` are printed when seed completes. See `packages/db/src/seed/ids.ts`.

### RBAC roles (canonical)

Platform capability roles only: `super_admin`, `admin`, `contributor`, `viewer`. Job titles are not RBAC enums.

Existing local databases: run `pnpm db:migrate` to apply migration `0001_capability_rbac_roles` (maps legacy `qa_lead` / `qa_engineer` values).

### Validate services

```bash
pnpm db:seed
pnpm db:validate-create-run
pnpm db:validate-update-case-result
```

### Internal API (dev auth header)

**Two terminals:** (1) `pnpm dev` — leave running; (2) curls or `pnpm api:validate`.

If health returns HTML or `jq` fails with “Invalid numeric literal”, the dev server cache is usually stale:

```bash
pnpm dev:reset   # stop :3000 and remove apps/web/.next
pnpm dev         # start fresh in terminal 1
```

Then use seeded user IDs via `x-relay-user-id`:

```bash
# Health
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq

# Create run (requires admin or super_admin — Shaun)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-relay-user-id: 01SEED00000000000000000003" \
  -d '{
    "projectId": "01SEED00000000000000000010",
    "testPlanId": "01SEED00000000000000000400"
  }' | jq

# Update case result (contributor — Priya). Replace RUN_ID and CASE_ID from create response / DB.
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/runs/RUN_ID/cases/CASE_ID/result" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-relay-user-id: 01SEED00000000000000000004" \
  -d '{"status": "pass"}' | jq

# HTTP validation (app must be running on :3000)
pnpm api:validate
```

Error responses use `{ "error": { "code", "message", "details?" } }`.

### Other commands

```bash
pnpm db:generate   # generate new migration after schema changes
pnpm db:studio     # Drizzle Studio
```
