# Claude Session Handoff

> Read this at the start of every new Claude (Cowork) session on this project.
> Update this file at the end of any session where meaningful work was done.

## Claude's role (read this first)
Claude is a **planning and prompt-drafting assistant**. It does not implement changes to project source files.

- Feature work → draft a Cursor agent prompt in `docs/cursor-prompts/`, then hand it to the user to run in Cursor.
- The only files Claude writes freely are `docs/claude/**` and `docs/cursor-prompts/**`.
- All actual code/config changes are made by Cursor agents working from those prompts.
- If explicitly asked to make a specific file change, that's the exception — not the default.

## Active branch
`mvp-test-plans` (branched from `mvp-test-runs`)

---

## Schema version
**Current: v11** (task-01 of mvp-test-plans will bump to v12)

| Version | What changed | Migration |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| v5 | Baseline before admin panel work | — |
| v6 | Added `activeCustomFieldIds: string[]` and `projectSettings?: ProjectSettings` to `Project` | v5→v6 adds `activeCustomFieldIds: []` to any project missing it |
| v7 | Added `template`, `references`, `summary`, `customFieldValues` to `Case` | v6→v7 backfills new fields with defaults on existing cases |
| v8 | Added `caseKey: string` to `Case`; added `nextCaseNumByProject` to `DemoState` | v7→v8 generates `TC-XXXXX` keys for all existing cases; seeds `nextCaseNumByProject` from existing case counts |
| v9 | Fixed `addCase` to use `newId('case')` — case ids are now globally unique across projects | v8→v9 remaps any case id matching `/^TC-\d{4}$/` to a fresh `newId('case')`; rewrites matching keys in `run.executions` and `run.caseOrder` |
| v10 | Added `resultNotes/testedAt/testedBy` to `CaseExecution`; `executionLog: ExecutionLogEntry[]` to `DemoRun` | v9→v10 adds `executionLog: []` to all runs; backfills missing execution fields with defaults |
| v11 | Added `createdAt?: string` to `Case` | v10→v11 sets `createdAt = updatedAt` for all existing cases |
| v12 | (task-01, mvp-test-plans) Added `TestPlan`, `TestQuery`, `QueryCondition` types; added `plansById: Record<string, TestPlan>` and `nextPlanNumByProject: Record<string, number>` to `DemoState`; added `formatPlanKey`, `planKeyToSlug`, `slugToPlanKey`, `resolvePlanCases` to `demo-model.ts`; seeds two demo plans (TP-00001 Smoketest, TP-00002 Full Regression) | v11→v12 adds `plansById` and `nextPlanNumByProject`; backfills seed plans for demo projects |

### Pending

Task 07b — **Complete** (Cursor confirmed build passes, all 9 fixes applied). Commit prompt at `task-07b-commit.md` — may still need to be run.

Task 07c — feedback fixes on Task 07b. **Prompt drafted** at `docs/cursor-prompts/mvp-test-runs/task-07c-runs-ui-polish-2.md`. 5 fixes verified against live Testiny:
1. Step-comment hyperlinking in Comments tab (click step label → jump to step in Details)
2. Defects/Requirements tabs corrected per context (interactive in correct screen, read-only in the other)
3. Create test run button fully guarded (run picker dropdown missed in 07b)
4. Team/Defects/Details tabbed panel next to pie chart; ec-pane min width → 475px, default → 500px
5. Delete safeguard: modal warning listing affected open runs; DELETE_CASE cascades to unsealed runs

**Key Testiny finding (item 5):** Deleting a test case removes it from open (unsealed) runs. Sealed runs are left untouched as immutable historical records. Warning dialog lists affected run keys.

Task 07d — feedback fixes on Task 07b/07c. **Prompt drafted** at `docs/cursor-prompts/mvp-test-runs/task-07d-runs-ui-polish-3.md`. 2 fixes:
1. Track "Record was created" in History tab when a case is added to a run — `ExecutionLogEntry` gains `event?: 'created'`; `ADD_CASES_TO_RUN` appends creation log entries; History tab renders "Record was created" with `var(--accent)` dot
2. Summary tabbed panel height to match donut chart (`align-items: stretch` on parent); Team tab shows "N cases assigned" per member; clicking a member toggles `advFilter.assignee` to filter the run list

### Task legacy 07c / 07d — legacy bug fixes

After Task 07b ran, two additional bugs were found:

**Edit/save creates duplicate case (07c)** — `addCase` in `FreshProvider` uses `nextCaseId(num)` which returns `TC-${1000+num}`. Every new project starts at counter 1, so all projects generate `TC-1001`, `TC-1002`, etc. `REPLACE_CASE` matches across all projects by id, corrupting cases from other projects and producing duplicate ids in `activeCases`. Fix: use `newId('case')` in `addCase`; add schema v9 migration to remap existing collision-prone ids. Addressed in `task-07c`.

**Project switch flicker / first attempt stays on P1 (07d)** — `ProjectRouteSync` includes `state.activeProjectId` in its effect deps. When `handleSelect` calls `setActiveProject(P2)` + `router.push('/P2/cases')`, the state change fires the effect immediately while `usePathname()` still reads `/P1/cases`. The effect sees URL=P1 vs state=P2 and calls `setActiveProject(P1)` — reverting the state. The reversion then causes `CasesScreen`'s URL sync effect to call `window.history.replaceState('/P1/cases')` mid-navigation, which aborts the `router.push` in Next.js 15. Fix: remove `state.activeProjectId` from the effect deps; read it via a ref instead. Addressed in `task-07d`.

## Key decisions (do not revisit without good reason)

- **"Type" is a built-in Case field, not a custom field.** Do not add it to `adminSettings.customFields` seed data. The DP project's `activeCustomFieldIds` seeds Priority, References, and Is Automated only.
- **Panel opens maximized by default.** `AdminProjectPanel` initialises `isMaximized: true` when `selectedProjectId` is set.
- **One Cursor agent per task.** Each prompt has a "Context from previous task" section for fresh agents. Remove that section when continuing with the same agent.
- **Always run `pnpm build` before committing.** Zero TS errors required.
- **Mandatory post-change smoke test** — after user-visible, route, schema, RBAC, or flow changes: build, dev server, browser smoke test with WebM/screenshots, QA report under `/tmp/relay-qa-<branch>/qa-report.md`. Do not push until reviewed or waived. See `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/product/feature-flow.md`.
- **Dev server restart command:** `cd /Users/shaun.sevume/Projects/Relay && bash scripts/reset-web-dev.sh && pnpm dev`
- **Commit after each task** as a checkpoint for easy rollback.
- **Committing doc changes** — after providing a commit message for `docs/claude/**` or `docs/cursor-prompts/**` edits, always offer to run the commit directly. Append `Co-authored-by: Claude <claude@anthropic.com>` to the message body. The repo has a local git config (`user.name=CrimsonDelta`, `user.email=30307439+CrimsonDelta@users.noreply.github.com`) — do NOT override it with `GIT_AUTHOR_*` or `GIT_COMMITTER_*` env vars; just run `git commit` directly and the local config will be used.
- **No backend work.** If a task appears to require it, stop and ask for confirmation.
- **Test Plans routing** — uses URL routing like RunsScreen (`/plans/tp/[planKey]`), not two-pane like CasesScreen. Route: `/:projectKey/plans` (list) / `/:projectKey/plans/tp/:planKey` (detail).
- **Condition query fields** — limited to existing `Case` fields (`title`, `priority`, `type`, `assignee`, `tags`, `caseKey`). Custom fields are NOT in scope for mvp-test-plans.
- **Cross-run heatmap** — deferred; not in MVP requirements. Coverage donut (% of project cases covered by plan) is in scope.
- **`planKey` format** — `TP-00001`; URL slug strips the `TP-` prefix (e.g., `/plans/tp/00001`). Use `planKeyToSlug`/`slugToPlanKey` for conversion.
- **Task granularity (mvp-test-plans)** — two larger tasks (task-01: data model + screen; task-02: test case tab) rather than five smaller ones.

## Gotchas encountered

- **Git amend broke the merge commit** when run from the sandbox (set the wrong committer, caused 57 files to appear unstaged). Fix: `git reset --hard origin/mvp-main` from the user's terminal, then re-amend. Do not pass `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` env vars — the repo has a local git config that handles identity correctly.
- **`.git/HEAD.lock`** blocked amend from the sandbox — user had to remove it manually from their terminal. The sandbox cannot `rm` this file; always ask the user to remove it if it appears.
- **Do not override git identity with env vars** — the repo local config sets `user.name=CrimsonDelta` / `user.email=30307439+CrimsonDelta@users.noreply.github.com`. Passing `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` or `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` overrides this and causes commits to appear under the wrong author.
- **`adminSettings` is not in the default `useFresh()` destructure** in CasesScreen — fixed in Task 03; it is now destructured there.
- **Case detail panel drag direction**: right-anchored panels need `start - dx` not `start + dx` — covered in task-03b prompt.
- **`formatRunKey` exists in `demo-model.ts`** — Task 06's `formatCaseKey` should follow the exact same pattern and live next to it.
- **`router.replace` across different page files causes full remount** — `/cases` and `/cases/tc/[caseKey]` are backed by different `page.tsx` files. Any `router.replace` between them remounts the component. Always use `window.history.replaceState` for in-component URL updates that should not trigger navigation. `ProjectRouteSync` still uses `router.replace` correctly for the unknown-project redirect case.
- **`window.history.replaceState` during an in-flight `router.push` aborts it** (Next.js 15) — This is why the CasesScreen URL sync effect (which calls `window.history.replaceState`) must not fire with stale project data during a project switch. Fixed in task-07d by preventing `ProjectRouteSync` from reverting state mid-navigation.
- **Project-switch flicker in RunsScreen (task-05b)** — `setActiveProject(P2)` fires synchronously before `router.push` commits. React re-renders with P2 state while `params.runKey` and `pathname` still show P1's run. The unknown-run redirect and auto-open effects both fire in this window, creating racing navigations. Fix: derive `projectMismatch` from `pathname`'s project key vs `activeProject.key`; bail out of all navigation/replaceState effects when they disagree. Same guard added to CasesScreen's URL-sync effect. **Fully fixed in RunsScreen. CasesScreen still has residual flicker (see Known Bugs).**
- **`ProjectRouteSync` must not depend on `state.activeProjectId`** — Adding it to deps causes the effect to fire when the switcher dispatches `setActiveProject`, while `pathname` still reads the old URL, creating a reversion race. Use a ref to read the latest value without triggering re-runs.
- **`CreateCaseModal` is always mounted** (returns `null` when closed, not unmounted). `useState` initialises only once. Use a `useEffect` watching `createCaseOpen` to reset field values each time the modal opens.

## What to do at the start of a new session

1. Read this file.
2. Ask the user which task Cursor has just finished (or is about to start) to calibrate the current state.
3. Update the "Completed work" and "Schema version" sections if tasks have been executed since this was last written.
